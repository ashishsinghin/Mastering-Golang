# **Structs in Go â€“ Custom Data Types for Real-World Models**

## **Overview**

In this lesson, you'll learn how to define and use **structs** in Go. Structs allow you to group related data into a single custom type, making your code more organized and aligned with real-world objects.

---

## **1. What is a Struct?**

A **struct** is a composite data type that groups multiple fields under one name.

### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```go
type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

---

## **2. Declaring and Using Structs**

### ðŸ”¹ Declaration and Initialization:

```go
var u User
u.Name = "Ashish"
u.Age = 28
```

### ðŸ”¹ Using Struct Literal:

```go
u := User{Name: "Ashish", Age: 28}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Field Order Initialization:

```go
u := User{"Ashish", 28}
```

---

## **3. Accessing and Updating Fields**

```go
fmt.Println(u.Name) // Output: Ashish
u.Age = 29
```

---

## **4. Structs with Pointers**

Pass struct pointers to functions to modify them:

```go
func updateAge(u *User) {
    u.Age = 30
}

user := User{"Ashish", 28}
updateAge(&user)
fmt.Println(user.Age) // Output: 30
```

---

## **5. Nested Structs**

### ðŸ”¹ Defining Nested Structs:

```go
type Address struct {
    City  string
    State string
}

type Employee struct {
    Name    string
    Address Address
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Usage:

```go
emp := Employee{
    Name: "John",
    Address: Address{
        City:  "Mumbai",
        State: "MH",
    },
}
fmt.Println(emp.Address.City) // Output: Mumbai
```

---

## **6. Anonymous Structs**

```go
person := struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}{
    Name: "Ravi",
    Age:  24,
}
```

---

## **7. Struct Tags and JSON Serialization**

Struct tags allow custom field names for encoding/decoding:

```go
type Student struct {
    FullName string `json:"full_name"`
    Grade    int    `json:"grade"`
}

import "encoding/json"

s := Student{"Kiran", 8}
data, _ := json.Marshal(s)
fmt.Println(string(data)) // Output: {"full_name":"Kiran","grade":8}
```

---

## **Practice Exercises**

1. Create a `Book` struct with `Title`, `Author`, and `Pages` fields.
2. Write a function that accepts a pointer to `Book` and updates the page count.
3. Create a `Company` struct that contains an `Employee` and nested `Address` struct.

---

## **Summary**

âœ… Structs model real-world entities with related data fields.
âœ… You can initialize, access, and update struct fields.
âœ… Pointers allow modification of structs inside functions.
âœ… Tags enable integration with JSON and other encoders.
