## **Overview**
In this lesson, we will explore what Go (Golang) is, why it was created, and how it compares to other programming languages. By the end of this lesson, you will understand the key features of Go and why it is widely used in modern development.

## **1. What is Go (Golang)?**
- Go is a modern, compiled programming language developed by Google.
- It was created in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
- Go is designed for simplicity, efficiency, and scalability.
- Although the official name is "Go," it is often referred to as "Golang" because of its website domain (golang.org).

## **2. Why Did Google Create Go?**
### **Problems in Existing Languages:**
Before Go, developers at Google faced challenges such as:
- **Slow Compilation** â€“ C++ had long build times.
- **Complexity** â€“ Java had excessive boilerplate code.
- **Inefficient Concurrency** â€“ Python and JavaScript struggled with multithreading.
- **Dependency Management Issues** â€“ Managing external packages in C and C++ was difficult.

### **How Go Solves These Problems:**
âœ… **Fast Compilation** â€“ Code compiles quickly.
âœ… **Simple Syntax** â€“ Clean, minimalistic code.
âœ… **Built-in Concurrency** â€“ Efficient handling of multiple tasks.
âœ… **Automatic Garbage Collection** â€“ No manual memory management.

## **3. Key Features of Go**

| Feature        | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| **Simplicity** | Clean, readable, and easy-to-learn syntax. |
| **Compiled & Fast** | Runs at C/C++ speeds. |
| **Concurrency** | Uses Goroutines for lightweight thread management. |
| **Garbage Collection** | Automatic memory management. |
| **Cross-Platform** | Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. |
| **Strong Standard Library** | Built-in packages for networking, file handling, and more. |
| **Static Typing** | Type safety to prevent runtime errors. |
| **Open Source** | Developed by Google, maintained by a large community. |
